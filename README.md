# Enhancing Security & Efficiency with Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) in Azure AD 
In my latest lab, I implemented Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) in Azure Active Directory, a critical feature that strengthens security while reducing IT workload.

âœ… Key Takeaways:

Enabled users to reset passwords securely without IT intervention.
Configured authentication methods for secure identity verification.
Improved account recovery efficiency, minimizing downtime and security risks.
Why it matters:

 ðŸ”¹ Reduces help desk costs by cutting down password reset tickets.

 ðŸ”¹ Strengthens access control while maintaining user autonomy.

 ðŸ”¹ Ensures business continuity, preventing lockouts from disrupting productivity.

Cybersecurity and IT teams must balance security and usabilityâ€”SSPR is a great way to achieve both! ðŸ’¡
